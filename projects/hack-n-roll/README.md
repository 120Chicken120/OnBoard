#Guitar Hero Arduino

I enrolled in a ADE (applied digital electornics) class we have been learning about circuts and coding and now we are on to our final. For the final we get to choose what we want our project to be and I thought it would be cool to do a Guitar hero arduino edition. I learned how to design a PCB and now all I need to do is write some code and get the PCB printed.

The Game:
The game will be a PCB in the shape of a guitar fretboard. There will be rows of leds on each "fret" patterns of leds will "fall down the fret board" and when they reach the bottom you must be pressing the correct button or you don't get the points. There will be an LCD display showing the number of points scored.
